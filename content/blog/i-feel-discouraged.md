title: I Feel Discouraged
description: "An attempt at a neutral acknowledgement of an unpleasant feeling.  "

It has been my experience that spontaneous, unpleasant feelings, whatever their cause, are more manageable if I can maintain some awareness that the feeling will pass and that I can let it be.  That I have plenty of time, and that it is healthy and perfectly fine to have some of that time spent slowing down and feeling.  Naturally if I had some vision for the day, and I'm visited unexpectedly by grief, it can be a startling and intensely unpleasant surprise.  I think that part of what I have learned is to understand -- grief comes knocking at all number of unexpected times, and I find that I like to feel well put-together, well-dressed, when they arrive.  Makes it harder for self-loathing to creep in, during grieving.  I find that for one reason or another,  my experience of grief has been that the feeling can run and bleed like blood or ink, and leak into feelings of self-loathing, hopelessness, exhaustion, depression, anxiety, drug desire.  

It is a sign of tremendous progress that I can write about it.  I don't know how I managed to convince myself to do it, but I did, and I'm feeling some relief from doing so.  Actually, after just a moment's reflection, i think what I did was create the conditions for myself to have a place to write easily, on this here blog.  I guess.  Something like that.  Okay.  Love you.
