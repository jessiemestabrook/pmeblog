I made an extremely stupid clothing store in one day.  That was my goal -- to see if, in December 2020, there exist adequate tooling to just connect some dots on the internet and create a clothing business where I would be in no way responsible for manufacturing or handling inventory at any point.

So, uh, what the **fuck** am I doing?

This is a list of things:

1. Personal space
2. I need my personal space.
3. Get out of my personal space.
4. Need my personal space.

Phew that was exhausting.

This is nice!

Are... are we blogging?  Is this blogging?  Do I have a fucking blog now?
